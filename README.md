## Description :house:

HolbertonBnB is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and
database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a
clone of AirBnB. The front-end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using
Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web
servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy.

HolbertonBnB is still in active development, with complete functionality set to
deploy in the coming month:

* Complete integration of a RESTful API
* Full configuration of website with domain name
* Serving of dynamic content using JavaScript

## NOTE TO 2019 LYFT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING APPRENTICESHIP RECRUITER

This web app has been the capstone project of my full-stack education at
Holberton School and I want to show it off as a demonstration of all the
skills I've learned at this school.

With that said, I must clarify that it is not complete. As mentioned, the
clone is a work-in-progress, with full deployment as a RESTful API still to
come. Finishing touches will be occurring over the next month, my final at
Holberton.

Recognizing that I am sharing a near-complete project, I additionally put
together a small Flask app according to the specifications described in the
application. Please take a look at this separate repository here:

https://github.com/bdbaraban/lyft_apprenticeship_application

Nonetheless, allow me to talk a little more about this AirBnB clone. This
repository is the second iteration of the project. In the first version
(viewable [here](https://github.com/bdbaraban/AirBnB_clone)), I, together
with a cohort mate, built up the initial file storage back-end and
console from scratch. We pair programmed for most all of this version one work.

In this second iteration of the project, I, together with a new partner,
inherited a different version of the same back-end written by a pair of
Holberton students from an older cohort. We then pair programmed
to build up the database storage engine of the back-end.
